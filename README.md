# word-search
This is a multi threaded program that checks if a word is in a file 
and if yes, prints each line where it occurs along with the line number


We have added some extra features:

1. option to search for whole words, or not
2. option to ignore case, or not
3. show progress bar
4. show the recent searches as suggestion
5. background worker is busy/not busy
